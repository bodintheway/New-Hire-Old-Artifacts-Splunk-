Scenario: You are a SOC Analyst for an MSSP (managed Security Service Provider) company called TryNotHackMe.


A newly acquired customer (Widget LLC) was recently onboarded with the managed Splunk service. The sensor is live, and all the endpoint events are now visible on TryNotHackMe's end. Widget LLC has some concerns with the endpoints in the Finance Dept, especially an endpoint for a recently hired Financial Analyst. The concern is that there was a period (December 2021) when the endpoint security product was turned off, but an official investigation was never conducted. 

Your manager has tasked you to sift through the events of Widget LLC's Splunk instance to see if there is anything that the customer needs to be alerted on. 

Happy Hunting!
